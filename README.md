# Goodsidian

This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

It is currently under construction and not usuable yet. You may want to use my [goodsidian script](https://github.com/selfire1/goodsidian) in the mean time.

## Contribute
My knowledge of Typescript is lacking and I'd love your help on building a Goodreads integration into Obsidian.

If you're willing to join, feel free to [contact me](https://joschuasgarden.com/Contact+me) or just open an issue or fork the project.

`Workbench` is the most recent experimental branch.

## Road to v1
- [ ] Try `xml2js`
- [ ] Import Goodreads rss into script
- [ ] Convert RSS xml to json
- [ ] Iterate over json, pulling out variables
- [ ] Globally pull out frontmatter + tags
- [ ] Match frontmatter with json
- [ ] Create a template for currently-reading
- [ ] Insert a line at specific point for read
- [ ] Create an editable template in setting
- [ ] Match json variables to text variables
Done!
