# Goodsidian

This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

It is currently under construction and not usuable yet. You may want to use my [goodsidian script](https://github.com/selfire1/goodsidian) in the mean time.

## Contribute
My knowledge of Typescript is lacking and I'd love your help on building a Goodreads integration into Obsidian.

If you're willing to join, feel free to [contact me](https://joschuasgarden.com/Contact+me) or just open an issue or fork the project.

`Workbench` is the most recent experimental branch.
